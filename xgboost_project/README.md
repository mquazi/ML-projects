# XGBoost
Predicting Lionel Messi's pass completion rate using XGBoost regressor.   
Motivation for this project is the fact that he burdens most of Barcelona's attacking prowess and Barca's results depend on him having a good game more often than not. 

This folder has all the files needed to execute this project. XGB regressor model is built and validated using MSE. 
Model requires a bit more fine tuning of parameters to minimize MSE and increase R^{2}. 
messidata.csv is the input file while xgboostcode.ipynb is the jupyter notebook script used.
