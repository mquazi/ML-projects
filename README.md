EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT ADHESIVE SYSTEMS ON PEEL STRENGTH

This repo has all the files needed to execute this project. Data is thoroughly analyzed, ANOVA model is built and its model assumptions are addressed. The analysis requires a fixed effect three factor ANOVA model. Multiple comparisons for treatments and different factors are made. datasetcsv is the input file while ANOVA CODE.R is the R script used.
