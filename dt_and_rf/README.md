# Decision Tree and Random Forest 
Predicting whether or not the borrower paid back their loan based on other variables.  

This folder has all the files needed to execute this project. Data is thoroughly analyzed, DT and RF models are built, validated, and compared as well. 
Used classification reports and confusion matrices for reports. 
RF algorithm outperforms DT model (which is expected). lendingclubdata.csv is the input file while DT_RFProject.ipynb is the script used.
