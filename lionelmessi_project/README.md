# Deep Learning Neural Networks 
Predicting Lionel Messi's pass completion rate using deep learning neural network with 2 hidden layers.  
Motivation for this project is the fact that he is an important player for Barcelona's attack and Barca's results depend on him having a good game more often than not. 

This folder has all the files needed to execute this project. Data is thoroughly analyzed, DLNN model is built and validated. 
Tried different optimizers such as adam, rmsprop. Tried different activation funcions such as relu, softmax. 
Rectified Linear Unit (relu) along with adam optimizer performs the best. 
messi.csv is the input file while MessiProject.ipynb is the jupyter notebook script used. 
webscrapingdata.R webscrapes the data for 2019/2020 season for Lionel Messi, output of which is messi.csv. 
messi_project_model.h5 is the ML (DLNN) model saved for later use.
