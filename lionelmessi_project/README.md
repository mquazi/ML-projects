# Deep Learning Neural Networks 
Predicting Lionel Messi's pass completion rate using deep learning neural network with 2 hidden layers.  

This folder has all the files needed to execute this project. Data is thoroughly analyzed, DLNN model is built and validated. 
Tried different optimizers such as adam, rmsprop. Tried different activation funcions such as relu, softmax. 
Rectified Linear Unit (relu) along with adam optimizer performs the best. 
messi.csv is the input file while MessiProject.ipynb is the jupyter notebook script used. 
webscrapingdata.R webscrapes the data for 2019/2020 season for Lionel Messi, output of which is messi.csv.
